7. You should get this response: "Details saved to credentials.json." Now go to the `auth/credentials.json` file that was just generated and use the details to set up `credentials.js` e.g.

   ```
   {
     "query_id": "XYZ123ArAwAAAPcLYCtmJT0h",
     "user_id": 1234567890,
     "first_name": "John",
     "last_name": "Doe",
     "language_code": "en",
     "allows_write_to_pm": true,
     "auth_date": "1620000000",
     "hash": "abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890"
   }

   ```
8. Now go over to the `config/config.js` and configure  your settings for managing tap actions and cycles within the application below Below are the details of each property in the configuration:

   ```
   const tapsConfig = {
       "coinsPerCycle": "22",      // Coins earned per 2 taps
       "numberOfTaps": "2",        // Number of taps to send in each cycle
       "cycleDuration": "5",       // Duration (in seconds) within which the taps should be sent
       "boostInterval": 9600000,   // Time interval (in milliseconds) between activating boosts
       "energyThreshold": 2000     // Energy limit, for example, 1000, 2000, or 2500
   }

   export default tapsConfig;

   ```
9. ðŸŽ‰ Voila! Now you can run the script. ðŸš€ Simply start up the script using `node server.js` so that we can restart the index every 30 minutes to get a new access token.

## Usage

## 1. Start the server:

```sh
node server.js  
```
